# Unexpected Snow

The snow was unexpected. Looking out the window, I saw the thick snowflakes fall through the dead branches of the trees that lined the street. I wish I could be outside enjoying the brisk weather, but the duties of life kept me inside. A family to take care of, a house to maintain, money to be made. Perhaps unplanned spontaneous days are over. I want freedom from work, but that isnâ€™t the way of things. Freedom comes from work. There are many spontaneous days ahead, as well as many planned days.
