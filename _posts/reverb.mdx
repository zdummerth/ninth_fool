# Reverb

The reverberating drum echoed from somewhere below. It reminded me of an old memory, something that I had longed to forget. What made this drum remind me? Was the rhythmic terror, or the unending call of the depths. I thought I couldn’t go lower, but when it comes to the mind, I always find the depths unimaginable. The drums continue to pound, and my thoughts continue to wander from time to place and back again. I want to find the source, but it is always just out of reach as it wisps away into the darkness. I want to understand. Then I realize that maybe the purpose isn’t to understand, but to live alongside it in time and place.
